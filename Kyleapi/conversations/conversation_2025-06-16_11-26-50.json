There are two types of simulations: SUMO and memory-based. For SUMO, there are functions like creating vehicles, simulating attacks, detecting intrusions, and getting stats. The memory simulation has functions for creating vehicles, stopping, resetting, etc.\n\nI should mention each function briefly, maybe with their purposes. For example, create_vehicle_memory for adding vehicles, simulate_attack for security threats, detect_intrusion for monitoring, and get_simulation_status to check status. Also, note the SUMO functions like start_sumo, start_sumo_simulation, stop_sumo_simulation, and create_sumo_vehicle.\n\nI need to make sure to explain each function's purpose without getting too technical. The user might not be familiar with all the details. Also, check if there's any missing information or if I need to clarify something. Since the user is asking generally, a simple list with brief descriptions should work.\n</think>\n\nI can perform the following tasks in VANET and SUMO simulations:\n\n**VANET Simulation (In-Memory):**\n1. Create vehicles (`create_vehicle_memory`)\n2. Stop simulation (`stop_memory_simulation`)\n3. Reset simulation (`reset_memory_simulation`)\n4. Get simulation status (`get_simulation_status`)\n\n**SUMO Simulation:**\n1. Start SUMO with TraCI (`start_sumo`)\n2. Create SUMO vehicles (`create_sumo_vehicle`)\n3. Simulate attacks (`simulate_attack`)\n4. Detect intrusions (`detect_intrusion`)\n5. Get simulation stats (`get_sumo_stats`)\n6. Query simulation data (`query_sumo_analysis`)\n7. Clear/reset simulation (`clear_sumo_simulation`)\n\nLet me know if you want to run a specific simulation!"
