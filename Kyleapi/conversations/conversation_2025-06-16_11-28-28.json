I need to figure out which tool to use here.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's one called query_sumo_analysis which allows natural language queries about the simulation. Since the user mentioned \"processing query,\" maybe they want to check the simulation data. The function requires a \"query\" parameter, so I should ask them to specify the type of query they want to make. \n\nI should respond by prompting them to provide the specific query they want to execute. That way, I can call the appropriate function with their input. Let me make sure I don't use any other functions here since the user hasn't given enough details.\n</think>\n\nTo assist with your query, please specify the type of analysis or simulation you want to perform. For example, you could ask about vehicle behavior, attack detection, or simulation statistics. Let me know your request!"
