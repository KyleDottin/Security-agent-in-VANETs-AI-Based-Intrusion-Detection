Hmm, maybe they forgot to paste it. Let me check the history. Oh, right, the user's message is just the instruction. So I need to ask them to provide the specific problem they want me to solve.\n\nI should respond by requesting the problem details. Let me make sure to be polite and clear. Maybe say something like, \"Sure! Could you please provide the specific math problem you'd like me to solve?\" That should get them to share the problem so I can assist properly.\n</think>\n\nSure! Could you please provide the specific math problem you'd like me to solve?",
