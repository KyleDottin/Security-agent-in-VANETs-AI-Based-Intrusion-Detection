prompt ="I’m an electric bus, currently traveling at 40 km/h with 30 passengers on board.
The road speed limit is 50 km/h. I’m 200 meters away from the next traffic light, which is currently green with 10 seconds remaining until it changes.
There are 2 vehicles waiting in front of the traffic light. The traffic light program indicates a cycle of 60 seconds.
The road has a slope of 3 degrees uphill, and the outside temperature is 20°C.
What is the best driving behavior to minimize energy consumption?"
