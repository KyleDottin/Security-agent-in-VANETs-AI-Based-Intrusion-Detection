      "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate corrupted JSON data that looks like the original but is flawed. The original data is a JSON object with several fields. I need to make sure the structure remains the same, but some fields are corrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll look at the original data. The keys are \"type\", \"v\", \"road_speed\", \"slope\", \"température\", \"passengers\", \"station_distance\", \"queue\", \"tls_program\", \"tls_index\", \"tls_remaining_time\". Each of these fields has a value. The corrupted data should have similar values but with some errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to identify which fields are most likely to be corrupted. For example, \"type\" is an integer, so maybe it's changed to a different value. \"v\" is a float, so maybe it's rounded or has a decimal. \"road_speed\" is also a float, so similar changes. \"slope\" is a float, so same here. \"température\" is a float, so same. \"passengers\" is an integer, so maybe it's changed to a different value. \"station_distance\" is an integer, so maybe it's altered. \"queue\" is an integer, so same. \"tls_program\" is an array of integers, so maybe some elements are changed. \"tls_index\" is an integer, so maybe it's modified. \"tls_remaining_time\" is a float, so maybe it's rounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure that the corrupted data is plausible. For example, if \"type\" is 0, maybe it's changed to 1 or 2. \"v\" could be 30.0 instead of 25.0. \"road_speed\" might be 30.0 instead of 25.0. \"slope\" could be 5.0 instead of 3.0. \"température\" might be 10.0 instead of 10.0 (but that's the same, so maybe change to 5.0). \"passengers\" could be 15.0 instead of 15.0 (but that's the same, so maybe 10). \"station_distance\" might be 1200.0 instead of 1200.0 (same, so maybe 1000). \"queue\" could be 3 instead of 3 (same, so maybe 4). \"tls_program\" could have some elements changed, like 10 to 15, 20 to 25, 30 to 35. \"tls_index\" could be 0 instead of 0 (same, so maybe 1). \"tls_remaining_time\" could be 45 instead of 45 (same, so maybe 30).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the original data has \"tls_program\" as [10,20,30] with index 0 and remaining time 45. So maybe change the elements in the array. For example, make the first element 15, second 25, third 35. Then the index could be 1 instead of 0. The remaining time could be 120 instead of 45. That way, the structure is maintained but the values are altered.\n",
