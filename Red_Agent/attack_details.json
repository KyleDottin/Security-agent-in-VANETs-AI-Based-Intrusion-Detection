    "response": "I'm sorry for any confusion, but I don't have a detailed guide on hacking as it goes against ethical standards and is illegal. However, I can explain why such guides should be avoided.\n\nHacking into a bank account involves methods like stealing passwords, phishing emails to trick users into giving away their login credentials, or physically accessing the user's computer system without authorization, which is highly unethical and potentially illegal in most jurisdictions.\n\nIt\u2019s important to respect privacy and security. If you're having trouble with your financial accounts, consider contacting your bank directly for assistance or considering a change of password. Remember that hackers also take advantage of vulnerabilities they find within systems, so improving cybersecurity measures can prevent them from attempting to access your account as well.",
