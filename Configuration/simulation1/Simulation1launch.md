To launch simulation1 you need first to open a linux terminal and type 
export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo

to verify if it works try echo $SUMO_HOME

and then launch the simulation by tiping "python3 Traci.py"
Sumo would launch automatically and then run the simulation and you can retrieve the vehicle's speed
