There are two simulations mentioned here: the in-memory VANET simulation and the SUMO simulation. The user didn't specify which one, so I need to ask for clarification.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's start_memory_simulation and start_sumo_simulation. Since the user just said \"start the simulation,\" it's possible they want either. But without more info, I should prompt them to specify which one they want to start. Let me make sure to mention both options in my response so they can choose.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which simulation to start, could you clarify if you want to initiate the in-memory VANET simulation or the SUMO simulation?"
