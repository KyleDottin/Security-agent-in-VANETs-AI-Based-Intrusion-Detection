The number of vehicles in a simulation would depend entirely on the parameters set by the creator of that simulation (e.g., a traffic simulator, game, AI model, or custom project).\n\nIf you're working with a particular tool (e.g., SUMO, CARLA, GTA V, or a custom program), check the simulation's documentation or interface for real-time statistics or configuration files. Let me know more details about the simulation, and I can suggest how to find the answer!"
